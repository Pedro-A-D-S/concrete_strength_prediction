# Concrete strength prediction

In this project, I aimed to make the prediction of the concrete strength in the Kaggle dataset available here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sinamhd9/concrete-comprehensive-strength

For this project, I've used regressor algorithms and the best performance was using the XGBoost Regressor with 86.91% accuracy.
